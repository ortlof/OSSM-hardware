# Printing the parts!

### Print Settings
All parts can be printed without need for support material
The OSSM base is the most structurally important piece, recommend using 6 perimeters/shells and 30% infill. The threaded end mount should also have a good number of perimeters.
Other parts are not so critical, and you can print with the settings you like on your printer.

### Belt Clamping
You can either print the **!Alternate Belt Clamp! 24mm Threaded End Mount.stl** or **OSSM Clamp Top** and **OSSM Clamp Bottom** The threaded end mount now has the belt clamp integrated and secured by the jam nut.
